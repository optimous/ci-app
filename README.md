Codeigniter app - Test

Test requirements:

1. Initialize a new GIT repo on your GitHub account.
2. Branch off of master, and commit to your branch as you work, as if on a team.
3. Create a new MySQL Database on your LAMP stack.
4. Install CodeIgniter on your LAMP stack (http://ellislab.com/codeigniter) and get familiar with the docs: http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/
5. Build us a sample CI application, including a page that has a form, with the following fields:
    -Name 
    -Date of Birth
    -Email
    -Favorite Color
    -Submit Button
6. Perform some client-side validation using jQuery (with jquery.validate or the like), and some server-side validation on your choice of fields.
7. Create a MySQL table with the same fields to catch this data.
8. Insert validated form data to the MySQL table, and display a friendly success message.
9. OPTIONAL: submit the form via AJAX.
10. Once finished, and satisfied with your work, pretend your pull request was approved, and merge you branch commits into master.
11. Put a SQL dump into the code repo, so we can re-create your database.
12. Push it all up to GitHub.
